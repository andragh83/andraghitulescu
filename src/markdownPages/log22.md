Factorial and Fibonacci exercises

<p>I've been posting on my Github account my coding practices exercises. Today I did Factorial and Fibonacii exercises with 2 approaces: iterative and recursive.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Return the factorial of a given number</p>
<p>You can see my code <a href = 'https://github.com/andragh83/codingPractice/blob/master/factorial.js' target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Return the number from the Fibonacci sequence of a given index</p>
<p>You can see my code <a href = 'https://github.com/andragh83/codingPractice/blob/master/fibonacci.js' target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
