Today I worked on my Personal portfolio website and on the Treatwell page replica.

<h3>Personal Portfolio Website</h3>
<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/andraghitulescu" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/andraghitulescu </a> </p>
<p>Live: <a href="https://www.andragh.co.uk" target="_blank"> https://https://www.andragh.co.uk/ </a></p>
<p>Every day I add a coding log here, just like this one, and looking at it every day, I realized I didn't like the way my log layout looked. It didn't say 'log', it looked more like a regular, boring page.</p>
<p>So this is what I did in the first part of my day, after reading a couple of Medium articles. I redesigned my log. I added a lighter color and I split it in two columns. The obvious choice for the right column would be to add a most recent logs section but I haven't decided yet.</p>
<h3>Treatwell page replica</h3>
<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica </a> </p>

<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>
<p>After that, I started working on the Map component of the Treatwell page replica. I added the logic for on map load displaying all the salons in a certain area but unfortunately I couldn't test it since the Google Maps API requires billing details to show these, diferent from the markers display which works, apart from the fact that the map is very dark.</p>
<p>I also worked a little on the salon cards component. I added some more content and I styled it further. I have a lot of work to do there since instead of a simple image, it contains a carousel.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
