Learning day on Udemy

<p>Today I carried on with Andrei Neagoie's 'Complete Junior to Senior Web Developer Roadmap 2021' course, which I started a little while ago but since I wanted to also apply to jobs, I begun working on my portfolio and left it aside for a while.</p>
<p>I did the SSH section and I begun the Performance Part 1 section. I had already used SSH several times before but never understood exactly how it worked until now.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
