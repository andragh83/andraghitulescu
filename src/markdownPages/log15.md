<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>I bumped my head all day today with absolute and relative positions, and overflows and overlapping. This is the most difficult part of CSS for me but I finally did it.</p>
<p>Sometimes CSS eats a lot of my time in a day but the good thing is after I pull something like this, a lot of CSS logic makes more sense to me than it did before.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
