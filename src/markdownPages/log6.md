Today I carried on with the Treatwell page replica project.

<p>I didn't get to work too mush on it as I wanted to also spend time with my family and I had to prepare the boys for school tomorrow. Finally...</p>
<p>I've added functionality for the 'Hide map' button and I built the card component.</p>
<p>The Google Maps API needs more study time as I'm getting several errors so looks like I'm gonna have to rebuild it from scratch.</p>
<p>Hope to get more done tomorrow with the boys finally in school!</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
