Working on the carousel of the Treatwell page replica + Portfolio update here
<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica </a> </p>
<p>Demo: <a href="https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/" target="_blank"> https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/ </a></p> 
<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>Today I tried to hard code by myself the animation of the carousel. I didn't want to use any libraries because I think it would be good CSS practice for me. I'm still working on it.</p>
<p>I also worked a little on my Github project descriptions, on my LinkedIn profile and also added the Treatwell Page replica to my portfolio here.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
