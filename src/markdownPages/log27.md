It's been so long since I've written a coding log! So much has happened!

<h3>I have a new job!</h3>

<p>Yes! It's true! And amazing! I didn't think I could do it but here I am, almost 11 months since I've landed a junior software engineer at the most awesome start-up, <a href='https://www.custodian.club/'>Custodian</a>, 'a team of petrolheads, engineers, and marketers in London, Los Angeles, and San Francisco redefining the automotive ownership experience'!</p> 
<p>I am working with cool, good people, passionate and always trying to help. I am having fun every day coding and learning new things!</p>

<h3>I've improved my coding skills!</h3>

<p>I have learned <strong>Typescript</strong> and how to use <strong>Redux Sagas middleware</strong>. Before, I was finding it difficult to work with basic Redux, and Thunks seemed very scary. But practicing has increased a lot my confidence in my coding skills, and my speed!</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to take my first steps into <strong>Golang (Go)</strong>, a relatively new, but very popular programming language for back-end development. And lucky for me, I have very good Go professionals who I can ask for advice! It really makes all the difference!</p>

<p>So yeah! I did it! I am a <strong>front-end software engineer</strong>! Yoo-hoo!</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
