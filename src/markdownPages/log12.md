Slow day today, just a couple of LeetCode coding challenges

<p>Today I had a busy family day and I didn't have a lot of time to code so I only did a couple of coding challenges on LeetCode.</p>
<p>The first was 'Two Sum' which was with arrays and was pretty easy.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold">Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.</p>
<p>I used two For loops, one with i=0 and one with j=i+1 and returned [i, j] if nums[i]+nums[j] met the target.</p>
<p>The second one was 'Add two numbers' and it implied linked lists.</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold">You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.</p>
<p>I haven't finished that one... must work more on linked lists.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
