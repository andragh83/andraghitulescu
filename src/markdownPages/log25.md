I joined HackerRank 30 Days of Code

<p>I'm on day 2. Up until now exercises are really easy but even so, I still get sloppy in my submits and everytime my first one is wrong :)) Must pay more attention to the requirements and the exemples.</p>

<p>Today I did the <span style="font-weight: bold">Operators exercise</span>.</p>

<p>You can see my code <a href = 'https://github.com/andragh83/codingPractice/blob/master/KeyboardsAndDrives.js' target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
