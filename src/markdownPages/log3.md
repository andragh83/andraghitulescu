Today I continued to improve my portfolio website.

<p>I've added a SEO component by following the official documentation from the Gatsby website. It was the first time I worked with the meta tags in a website and I ran into some errors but managed to quickly fix.</p>
<p>I've also added a favicon and I wanted to do this without installing any other plugin and chose not to use the official Gatsby guide which advised to use the gatsby-plugin-manifest.</p>
<p>First I tried to add it in the query I used for the SEO component but it didn't work so I did a little research and turns out a simple import of the image and a return of a link tag without querying worked wonders.</p>
<p>I don't know if this mannefr of adding the favicon would affect performance or be considerred 'messy code' but I will investigate.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
