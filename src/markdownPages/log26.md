Some work on the calendar in the Treatwell page replica and HackerRank day 4

<h3>Treatwell Page replica</h3>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica </a> </p>
<p>Demo: <a href="https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/" target="_blank"> https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/ </a></p> 
<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>I've noticed that my calendar wasn't working properly. It allowed users to select past dates so this is one thing I fixed.</p> 
<p>Than, when doing more tests, I realised that the onClick event cancels my focus pseudo-class that is meant to show the user it has selected a certain date. This one I couldn't yet fix but I'm working on it. I have to figure out what is causing this behaviour.</p>

<h3>Coding practice</h3>

<p>Day 4 of '30 Days of Code' on HackerRank. Pretty easy, it was Class vs Instance, but I didn't really feel it was about that as the challenge required to just fill in the body of some functions with conditions and increments.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
