Coding practice and more work on the Treatwell page replica

<h3>Treatwell Page replica</h3>

<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica </a> </p>
<p>Demo: <a href="https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/" target="_blank"> https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/ </a></p> 
<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>Today I refactored some code in the Treatwell page replica and worked some more on the integration of the data comming from the map component with the data from my dummy database.</p> 
<p>I also added an overlay warning window that loads at the first render of the website where I clarify the fact that this is a practice project, and it has nothing to do with the original website.</p>

<h3>Coding practice</h3>

<p>Today I tried HackerRank. I found it more friendly than LeetCode and it helped raise a little my confidence. I solved two challenges:</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Pairing socks</p>
<p>You can see the problem text and my code <a href = 'https://github.com/andragh83/codingPractice/blob/master/Socks.js' target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">Count Valleys</p>
<p>You can see the problem text and my code <a href = 'https://github.com/andragh83/codingPractice/blob/master/CountValleys.js' target = '_blank'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Happy coding!</p>
