Treatwell page replica - building a calendar picker component from scratch

<p>Today I worked all day at building a calendar picker component. Of course, I could've installed one of the many npm packages available but I thought it would be fun and also good practice.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy, it wasn't very hard, but it was a lot of work and a lot of testing.</p>
<p>I'm happy I've finished it in one day and that I didn't use any new dependency. It needs a little refactoring but I'll be able to use it in other projects too. I'm thinking I could turn it into an npm package. It would be an oportunity for me to learn a new skill. I saw a bunch of tutorials online on this so maybe I'll give it a try sometimes.</p>
<p>In testing the calendar component today, I've also spotted a bug in the time picker, with the 'Any time' option, that I'll tackle tomorrow. It has to do with calling multiple actions on one single event. I'll have to investigate this tomorrow.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
