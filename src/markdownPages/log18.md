Working on the map component of the Treatwell page replica + Portfolio website updates

<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>I started the day by polishing up my 'About me' page and removing some outdated projects from the 'Projects' page.</p>
<p>After this, I set up my billing info for the Google Maps API and started to work some more on the Map components of the Treatwell page replica. After reading the Google Maps API docs and checking up some stackoverflow Q&As, I managed to display info windows for all beauty salons in a given area but my code is really messy, I'll have to refactor it soon.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
