Treatwell page replica - making it responsive

<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>Today I kept working on the Treatwell page replica project.</p>
<p>For the most part, I've coded to make it responsive for mobile viewports. Some media queries, some javascript, some more icons and it looks good for now.</p>
<p>I've also added the logic for getting the prefered time interval input in the collapsable form. Tomorrow I want to add the calendar picker too and finish with the date and time input so I can start working on the location input.</p>
<p>I've looked more into the Google Maps API, Geolocation API and places library which I guess I'm gonna need for working on the Map component.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
