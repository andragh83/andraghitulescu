I am really excited! I built this website using Gatsby & GraphQL and it's a really neat React-based framework to work with! I really love it! Looking forward to learning new things about it today!

<p>Will update this post later, after I've attended some presentations.</p>

<h3>Today's coding</h3>
<p>In the mean time, I'll update my website too and add it to my LinkedIn profile because I think it's about time I do that, even though it's not final final and I'll keep improving it and adding content. </p>
<p>No day without coding, right?!</p>
