Today it's the first day of the GatsbyConf 2021! I am really excited! I built this website using Gatsby & GraphQL and it's a really neat React-based framework to work with! I really love it! Looking forward to learning new things about it today!

<h3>GatsbyConf 2021, day 1</h3>

<p>Will update this post later, after I've attended some presentations.</p>

<h5>Later edit:</h5>
<p>So I watched several presentations in the GatsbyConf but since I'm a rookie developer, there were lots of things I didn't get. But I got to write a lot of stuff down that I want to digg deeper into and learn about and maybe use them myself.</p>

<p>That said, there were 2 presentations that I really liked and were easy to understand for me:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Internalisation of websites by Andre Zimpel from Unknown Studios</li>
    <p>He talked about the benefits og using Gatsby when having a website that uses the Contentful CMS and Shopify and how GraphQL makes it very easy to easily query both sides of the website.</p>
    <li>A presentation by Francois Brill from BigBrave</li>
    <p>He talked about how they used Gatsby to build a platform called Flexisite for speeding up their websites building, going from a cycle of about 4 weeks to 4 hours! (waw!)</p>
</ul>

<h3>Today's coding</h3>
<p>In the mean time, I'll work some more on my website too and add it to my LinkedIn profile because I think it's about time I do that, even though it's not final final and I'll keep improving it and adding content. </p>
<p>No day without coding, right?!</p>

<h5>Later edit:</h5>
<p>So I managed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resize some images and remove some unused ones</li>
<li>Improve the layout of my Contact form and connect it to the Netlify form feature</li>
<li>Fix some responsive styling</li>
<li>Adjust the CodingLog template component</li>
</ul>
