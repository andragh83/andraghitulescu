I am really excited! I built this website using Gatsby and GraphQL and it's a really neat React library to worked with! And it's going places! More and more people are starting to use it and I intend to get better at it with each day.

<p>Will update this post later, after I've attended some presentations.</p>
<p>Also, in the mean time, I'll update my website too and add it to my linkedIn profile because I think it's about time I do that, even though I'll keep improving it and adding content. No day without coding, right?!</p>
