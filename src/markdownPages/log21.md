Working on the map component of the Treatwell page replica

<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>I started the day reading up on some JavaScript interview questions.</p>
<p>Then I started working on the Treatwell page replica, on the Map component.</p>
<p>I also fixed some styling which wasn't working well on iPhone 12 causing some elements to overlap.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
