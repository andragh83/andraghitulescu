Today I started a new React project. I'm trying to replicate a small part of an existing website.

<p>I'm using hooks, Redux and I'm styling with CSS modules.</p>
<p>I'm also going to use the Google Maps API to get the state of some components which are based on location.</p>
<p>I've coded about half of it today and I'm hoping to finish a first draft by the end of the weekend.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
