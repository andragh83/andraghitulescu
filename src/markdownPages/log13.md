Treatwell page replica - Adding carousel to salon card
<p>Repo: <a href="https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica" target="_blank"> https://github.com/andragh83/treatwell-page-replica </a> </p>
<p>Demo: <a href="https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/" target="_blank"> https://andragh83.github.io/treatwell-page-replica/ </a></p> 
<p>Original <a href='https://www.treatwell.co.uk/places/treatment-balayage/offer-type-local/in-west-london-london-uk/'>Treatwell page I'm trying to replicate</a></p>

<p>Today I added the carousel to the salon cards but I didn't finish it yet. I still have to add some animations like the fading in of the arrows and the slide to right of the photos. Right now it only has the functionalities of a carousel that's triggered on click. No smooth transitions yet though.</p>
<p>More tomorrow.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
